# notGPL (Gallon's Public Libraries)
A bunch of "def" like functions and whatnot that I decided to make public. I made these as part of my classes in tec.mx.
As you can see, I'm new to this. I actually created this as part of a proyect for a class where we are supposed to create some sort of portfolio on what we have done. But I haven't done much coding at all.
Maybe one day I'll come around and fix this / make it look more professional. For now though, I'll just toss my creations and/or code here. 
Figured it'd be useful to someone.
I might change the license too at some point, be aware.
Made this on Portafolio Creativo Digital, on Sept 2025.
